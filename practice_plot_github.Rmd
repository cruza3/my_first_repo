```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue") -> myplot

ggsave("practice_plot.png", myplot)
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
